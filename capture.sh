#Name: Forenzix Investigation Script to start and automate the investigation Script for bash (using qemu).


#This script was designed for Forenzix (a Linux distro under development to document and capture an evidence


#disk, then virtualize it and connect it to iNetSim or something similar and observe its function.


#This script assumes that it is being run on either BackTrack 5R3 or Kali in Forensics Mode installed on


#one partition of a dual partition USB drive.  That USB drive should have 1 partition with Kali and the other is used to store the evidence captures.  This script assumes that the second (evidence capture) partition is mounted in /mnt/ev.


#This script assumes (for the first released version) that there is no persistence setup in the Kali live iso.


#Specify bash as the appropriate shell to use

#!/bin/bash

#This script will reside on a non-persistent live USB, therefore all packages must be installed prior to the

#investigation beginning, for now.



#Load in available disks on the system

#echo ${devices[0]} This was used for troubleshooting my array listing

#List on the screen all available hard disks for investigator to capture

#first list with labels, etc.
